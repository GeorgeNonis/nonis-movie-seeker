Project Description :page_with_curl:
<p>
  This project, Unraveling Noni's World, was undertaken with the goal of enhancing my frontend development skills using Next.js, a popular React framework. By working on this project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with Next.js and explore its features and capabilities.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing best practices in front-end development, including efficient component architecture, responsive design, and optimized performance. I also incorporated modern tools and libraries such as TypeScript, Redux, and React-Stitches to ensure a robust and scalable codebase.
</p>
<p>
  The project showcases my ability to build interactive and user-friendly web applications, leveraging the power of Next.js and the selected tech stack. I have utilized industry-standard patterns and followed established coding conventions to ensure maintainability and readability of the code.
